# New Super Mario Bros.Wii: The Prankster Comets
## Public Resources Release

### Information 

This repo includes some of the resources used to make the [**New Super Mario Bros.Wii: The Prankster Comets**](https://youtu.be/5QI8ACl1E9c) game mod, which is a mod of **New Super Mario Bros. Wii** based on [**Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii**](https://newerteam.com/wii/).

These resources include:
- The game's source code (`Kamek` folder)
- The game's code loader (`Loader` folder)
- An all-in-one toolbox to edit various of the custom file formats used in the game (`PranksterToolbox` folder)

This repo is (meant to be) a fork of the [/Newer-Team/NewerSMBW, clang-no-translations branch](https://github.com/Newer-Team/NewerSMBW/tree/clang-no-translations) repo since part of [**Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii**](https://newerteam.com/wii/)'s code was used in [**New Super Mario Bros.Wii: The Prankster Comets**](https://youtu.be/5QI8ACl1E9c).

Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't allow to fork the same repo more than once so this repo isn't marked as a fork.

### Usage of this code

This repo is meant as a public archive for people to take parts from to make their own **New Super Mario Bros. Wii** mods better. Feel free to use anything as long as credits are given (see Credits section below).

HOWEVER, please do NOT try to "finish" the [**New Super Mario Bros.Wii: The Prankster Comets**](https://youtu.be/5QI8ACl1E9c) game mod. It is CANCELLED and I do not wish for it to be revived by anyone.

While I can't really do anything to prevent people from doing so, if someone does try to revive the mod I will publicly state that it was done without my consent and that I encourage not to play said mod.
