# Level Info Editor
(1.5-TPC)

----------------------------------------------------------------

Level Info Editor is a program which can edit and save copies of LevelInfo.bin from Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii.

This version was modded to add new features to the LevelInfo.bin file format and changes some minor details too. It is required to edit NSMBW: The Prankster Comets's LevelInfo.bin.

You can import Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii LevelInfo.bin files, though. Make sure to use the "Open Old..." option.
